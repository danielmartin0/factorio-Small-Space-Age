# Small Space Age

Each planet is replaced by a hyperbolic projection of limited size, matching the style of this MC Escher image:

Rockets travel directly between planets; this mod depends on [No Space Platforms](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Space-Age-Without-Platforms).

Resources are infinite, but patches are generally small. Enemy bases far from spawn are indestructible (this can be disabled by a setting).

Modded planets are typically supported, though any terrain generated outside the engine's terrain generation system will be unaffected.
